h1. Tile Active Window

h2. Introduction

@tile_active_window@ is a python script for tiling the currently active window into some preset locations on the screen. It uses the @wmctrl@ Linux utility to resize and move windows and the @xbindkeys@ utility to bind itself to keyboard shortcuts.

h2. Usage

I would recommend installing the tool as described in the installation section. However if you want to use this script yourself you may use it as follows...

bc. tile_active_window <preset_location>

h3. Preset locations (and shortcuts)

* left (Win+Left)
* top (Win+Up)
* right (Win+Right)
* bottom (Win+Down)

The following key bindings should make sense when you try them out.

* q1 (Win+Numpad 5)
* q2 (Win+Numpad 4)
* q3 (Win+Numpad 1)
* q4 (Win+Numpad 2)

* maximize (Win+Numpad 0)


h3. Logs

Optional debug log location: @/var/log/tile_active_window.log@. You may need to change the value of the DEBUG variable in tile_active_window to @1@ to enable logging. Set it to @0@ to disable logging.

h2. Installation

*Please backup relevant files before installation.*

You can either download a release package or clone the git repository.

bc. sudo apt-get install wmctrl xbindkeys
sudo ./tile_active_window install

p. As part of the installation the tile_active_window script will be copied to @/usr/bin@  and the @.xbindkeysrc@ file will be copied to your @$HOME@ directory.

h2. Troubleshooting

h3. The keyboard shortcuts are not working.

Make sure xbindkeys has been installed and is running.

bc. ps aux| grep xbindkeys

p. If @xbindkeys@ is not running run it using the @xbindkeys@ command. @xbindkeys@ should start automatically after a system restart henceforth.

Also check if @~/.xbindkeysrc@ exists and is valid

bc. ls ~/.xbindkeysrc
less ~/.xbindkeysrc
